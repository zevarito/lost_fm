LostFM is library wrapper for the LastFM API
--------------------------------------------

LostFM is based on the initial work of [Christopher Burnett](https://github.com/digitalscientists/ruby-last.fm-wrapper).

This is a sandbox library, I am not sure if you want to use this, there is other libraries for ruby that probably you want to try first.

This approach is based on Metaprogramming using *method_missing* and theorically you can call any method of the LastFM api, but to be sure
of what is working is better to take a look at the tests.
